- Pages should be re-loadable. Don't have pure client-side state if we can avoid it. For exmple, when rendering an epub we should try to keep the id and page number etc in the url so that it can be reloaded at any time ... obviously we won't be perfect here, but let's not be obnoxious ...
- NEVER import local .js files. This is a typescript project. That should never be necessary.
- Do things the right way. If that isn't working, it can be better to kick it back to me and we can discuss. Sometimes you tend to thrash and create horrible workarounds. This doesn't help. Don't do it.
